This is the repository for the Brown History Department's internal website to process faculty course proposals.

The `prefill_courses` and `prefill_profs` scripts read from a spreadsheet of courses/professors and upload them to the database. This is useful if you have a large number of courses/professors that you don't want to insert manually. Since the website is up and running, such backfilling is likely not required anymore.
